## Work Experience
#### Pompeu Fabra University
*Higher Education and Research*

**Research Fellow**, Barcelona, Spain, 2018-current

* Led lecture and/or lab sections for the following university courses: Radio Communications, Networks, Blockchain Technologies
* Constructed a theoretical framework for the integration of distributed ledger technologies and Radio Frequency interfaces, through an extension of the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model. A paper on this work is listed in the publications section.  
* Constructed a functional prototype of decentralized network access control using a custom-built "longest chain" consensus algorithm implemented in Python. A paper on this work is listed in the publications section.
* Constructed and modeled an autonomous merge algorithm for vehicle networks utilizing network localization, implementating them in Java using the VSimRTI network simulator. 

#### Twitter.com
*Social Media and Internet*

**Systems Engineer II**, San Francisco, US, 2014-2017

* Hired to scale company phone system, and deploy IT infrastructure (IaaS) at global office builds. Scaled company phone system from 2 vendor installations, to 23 locations on 5 continents.
* Designed global SIP VoIP network that reduced Twitter's phone network costs globally 72%, reduce delivery time from 12 weeks to 2, and allow full remote deployment in 41 countries. This was acheived by virtualizing physical telecom switches, and migrating from static ISDN, to SIP-based internet peering.
* Completed Cisco, Juniper, ShoreTel, VMWare, and CentOS Linux DHCPd network deployments in Australia, Brazil, France, Ireland, India, Singapore, United Kingdom, and the United States.

#### Salesforce.com
*Cloud Computing*

**Network Engineer**, San Francisco, US, 2012-2014

* Coordinated with real-estate business unit and stakeholders to set IDF and MDF requirements at newly
deployed and acquisition facilities globally, including network link sizing, cooling capacity, power capacity, as well as MDF and IDF rack layouts.  
* Principle network deployment engineer; completed network installations to facilities in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia.
* Domain owner for VoIP, Wireless, and Unified Communications operations. Managed and delivered training to the Global Network Operations Center for Voice product support.
* High availability support for Cisco LAN, WAN, Wireless and VPN, Juniper firewall, and F5 Load Balancer systems.

*Heavy Industry and Manufacturing*

**Information Technology Analyst II**, Peoria, US, 2007-2012

* Completed service and platform design for new satellite connected “field view” product support. Service utilized Librestream industrial cameras, Inmartsat connectivity, and Tandberg Cisco network gateways to allow screen sharing, live video markup, and remote support of Caterpillar industrial machines. Pilot services deployed to facilities in Canada, Czech Republic, and the United States.
* Created and managed “follow-the-sun” support team for phone network totalling 60,000 phone and video terminals across 50 countries, utilizing 3 teams at facilities in Belgium, Singapore, and the United States.
* Deployed Cisco IP Phone and HD Telepresence video conference networks to facilities in Australia, China, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States.
